According to the datasheet the transparent serial modules and DTU (module in a case) have
a super secret code that protects the data being transmitted.
The super secret code is XOR'ing a byte of a static key with each byte of data being sent.
Recovering the key is trival and all units apparently use the same key.. doh.
